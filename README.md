# Data Sciecne Capstone Project

This repository contains capstone projects that include all the data science methods and algorithms needed for a particular project. I've created these for academic, self-learning, and other educational purposes.

### 1. Real Estate Capstone Project
Problem Statement : 
A banking institution requires actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investment, and real estate analysis.
The mortgage bank would like to identify potential monthly mortgage expenses for each region based on monthly family income and rental of the real estate.
A statistical model needs to be created to predict the potential demand in dollars amount of loan for each of the region in the USA. Also, there is a need to create a dashboard which would refresh periodically post data retrieval from the agencies.
